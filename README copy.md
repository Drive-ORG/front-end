# Resume

This is my resume. I also made it public so you can watch my handwrite.

## Getting Started

First, install pnpm using npm

```bash
npm i -g pnpm@8.6.12
```

then install all of the dependencies of the project with

```bash
pnpm i
```

at last, run development server using

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can see all of the commands you can run with pnpm on this project by visiting package.json scripts.
